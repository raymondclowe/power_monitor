In the context of using the `ping` command with `-c 5`, you can check if all the pings are successful or not. When you use `ping`, it sends a certain number of packets 
(in your case, 5), and if at least one of them is successful, the exit status will be `0`. If all packets fail, the exit status will be non-zero.

The order of the success or failure does not matter; what matters is at least one successful response being received.

Hereâ€™s a sample command that you might use in a script to check the results of `ping` and take action based on the outcomes:

```bash
ping -c 5 <hostname_or_IP> > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
echo "Ping successful"
else
echo "All pings failed"
fi
```

Replace `<hostname_or_IP>` with the target you want to ping. This will check if there was at least one successful ping among the 5 attempts.
